/**
 * @file `useReactivePuck()` — reactive Puck-state selector hook.
 *
 * Puck's docs reserve `useGetPuck()` for callbacks/effects: it returns
 * a non-subscribing snapshot getter, so reading it during render does
 * NOT re-render when Puck state changes. UI whose output must react to
 * Puck state (selection summaries, breadcrumbs, overlay placement)
 * should use a `createUsePuck()` selector instead — it re-renders only
 * when the selected value changes by `Object.is`, so projecting a
 * narrow slice costs the same as a Zustand selector subscription.
 *
 * `createUsePuck()` is constructed lazily at first call (module-scoped
 * singleton) so partial test mocks of `@puckeditor/core` that only
 * stub `useGetPuck` do not crash transitive importers at
 * module-evaluate time. After the first call the same hook reference
 * is invoked unconditionally every render, satisfying the Rules of
 * Hooks. Mirrors the proven pattern in
 * `studio/state/useTextSelection.ts`.

 * Why the try/catch around a hook is safe here: Puck's `usePuck`
 * calls `useContext` FIRST and throws before any further hook when
 * the context is absent (verified against `createUsePuck` in
 * `@puckeditor/core@0.22`). A mounted component can never move in or
 * out of the provider without remounting, so the hook count is stable
 * per component instance — exactly the invariant the Rules of Hooks
 * protect. This exists for renderers that production always mounts
 * inside `<Puck>` but that unit tests (and potentially hosts) mount
 * bare — optional enhancements like the reset affordance degrade to
 * `fallback` instead of crashing the field.
